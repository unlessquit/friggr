# As a sender I want easily send one image from [phones share menu/desktop/email/browser] to one receiver
## As a sender I want to have picture appropriately downsized (based on receivers screen resolution) before sending, so I'll conserve my FUP. (Phone only)
## As a sender I want to have chance to add a title to the picture, so I have common reference to talk about with receiver
## As a sender I want to enqueue (fullsize?) picture to be send immediately when I'm on WiFi, to control FUP, or roaming costs
## As a sender I want to be optionaly notified that picture was [delivered to/seen by] the receiver (phone -> notification; email -> email responose)


# As a receiver I want to by notified on my [tablet/phone] about new incoming image, so I can see the image ASAP while my current operation is not aborted
# As a receiver I want to browse last 5-50 pictures, even offline, so I can enjoy my grandchildren even when not new photos are comming
# As a receiver I want to have automatically opened new image, and displayed it for 20s, so I can use tablet as a photo frame
